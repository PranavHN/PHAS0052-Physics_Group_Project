Consider and talk about issues and discrepancies in the report. DON'T HIDE IT

Group report (3000 words)
	- Overall research report, like previous lab reports
	- Don't talk too much of the general background and yap
	- Talk about it as though you are talking to another 3rd year
		- Similar knowledge but not quite (machine learning, numerical computation equations, etc)
	- Nothing new to be mentioned in the conclusion
		- Summarise the project
		- Talk about issues with the model and what we ignore (backwards reactions, entanglement in the surface of stars [sunspots], etc)

Individual report (1500 words)
	- Your individual contributions, here's my contribution, what the model does etc. Targeted (but contextualised) to what you've done.
	- Content can overlap slightly based on what the contributions are

Poster
	- Introductory, theory, etc, density, etc
	- What the code does do/doesn't do/assume
	- Key results/plots
	- [Very] Short conclusions
	- Acknowledgements
	- Aim to do it ASAP
	- Interactive elements
		- Demo (particles smashing)
		- Small video
		- Little model
