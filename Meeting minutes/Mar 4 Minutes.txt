- Correction factor is useful but too early to consider at this point rn
- Temperature and density should not be constant:
	- Consider temperature as a function of the rates taking place?
	- E = kT, E = mass difference
- Consider plots of reaction rates over time
	- Average rate of each cycle (e.g. average CNO reaction, etc)
	- Gamow window?
- Energy contributions from each reaction over time/temperature
- Finalise the plots for the poster
- Start considering the poster session
	- Interactive aspect to the display
- Look at the coulomb barrier at O16+(p/alpha)
	- Limits of heavy element formation
