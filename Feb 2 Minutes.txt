Minutes: 04/02

Risk Assessment:
- Consider hat are the implications of them happening?
- Who is at risk? Everyone...
- Electrocution is VERY SEVERE XD
- Read through the comments

pp chains:
- Consider the weighting of the different pp chains

CNO:
- Cross section if a function of energy and other variables and not just a constant
	- Competing reactions can affect the probability of reaction we want
- Look at CNO2


Code & physics:
- Consider merging our code bases together and get them working together
- Look into starting to see reactions in different sections: temperature as a function parameter
- How fast is CNO compared to pp?
- Start work on x3 alpha
- Start research on the Hoyle state
	- The problem of Be8 being too unstable
- Elements beyond CNO:
	- neutron/proton capture
	- alpha capture
	- Can they happen in a main sequence start?
- When are particles unable to break the Coulomb barrier?

General work:
- Consider a group book for everyone to share and look at
- Create a logbook of code of work
- Make a gnatt chart
	- Midterm review
	- Heavy element formation
	- Poster
	- Report
	- Lit/model comparison
