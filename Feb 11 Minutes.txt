Spectroscopic factor

Gamow window (MB Distribution & Coulomb barrier Break prob)

- Higher temp means more energy
- Likely hood of particle interaction
- Consider the probability of this in code
- Consider the relevance of spin parity of N15 & O16 and if/how it affects decay

Look at literature for the sun to look at abundances to see where to stop

Consider the different layers of the Sun & the temperatures

- Interactions between layers
- Shell mixing

How does positron amount affect reaction rates/probability?

Read through literature on experimental methods.

- Eg pathways of O16
